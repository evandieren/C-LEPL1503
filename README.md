This repository is a collection of the exercises done as part of the LEPL1503 course focused on learning the C-language as well as carrying out a group project.

These exercices solutions are entirely based on my own work (+ minor changes from Jean-Christophe Bauduin). If the LEPL1503 professors do not want these resolutions to be public, do not hesitate to contact me.
